Welcome to my website! I sometimes (though not very often -_-) do blog
posts here! I am a programmer from Sweden that has made some interesting
things, like [pearlOS](https://github.com/ElisStaaf/pearlOS), the semi-useful
operating system or maybe [ScreamLang](https://github.com/ElisStaaf/scream), the
programming language from hell! I don't really know, do I? Haha, enjoy my website!
