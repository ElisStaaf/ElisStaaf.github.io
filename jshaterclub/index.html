        <pre>
For years now, javascript and javascript devs have been opressing us
for too long. You might have noticed that my website isn't written,
at all, in javascript. That's because I'm part of the jshaterclub.
A club of dedicated javascript haters, united as one. Join today
and we can together fight the emalgamation that is javascript!
Javascript haters, unite! Join the jshaterclub today!
