        <p>
            My name is Elis Staaf and I'm a swedish computer programmer. I love anything low-level,
            C, Rust, you name it! I've probably used it before! I've made many things over the years,
            and I've gone trough many, many sleepless nights, just trying to find that one null pointer.
        </p>
