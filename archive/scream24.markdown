Scream24 (Scream revision 2024) is a programming language completely written in
incoherent screams. It includes such incredible instructions, such as
``AAEEeuueoeoaEAEOeueAEOAEOAEeueAOEOEAeueuaEOeOEUEUAEeoaoeUAEEA``.
I've featured scream24 in my blog post titled
["Worst language ever: The sequel"](https://elisstaaf.github.io/projects/2025/01/04/worst-language-sequel.html)
