# Vine text editor
Vine is a text editor based upon the "kilo" text editor by
Salvatore "Antirez" Sanfilippo. Vine improves greatly upon the kilo
text editor, it (for example) includes more shortcuts (ex. Ctrl+D
= dd in vim). Click on any of the files below to view them. Vine
is released under the "Apache 2.0 License".
