Books/Essays/eBooks I've written. They are... Somewhat readable

## [Waiting For Marxocracy](waiting-for-marxocracy/prologue):  
A view into the political status and dicatorships of the FOSS
community from the perspective of me -- a Marxist. This free
eBook dives into FOSS-democracy, meritocracy and BDFLs and
tries to lay out a reliable system which can be used by
FOSS-projects worldwide while still remaining democratic.
