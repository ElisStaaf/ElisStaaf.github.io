# Meritocracy
*"The US is a meritocracy"*, one of the most blatant lies
ever told. There's no benefit to working hard, only the people
born into wealth (maybe by your father owning an emerald mine
in Africa, but I don't know) say this, either by blissful
ignorance or out of pure malice. But one thing often overlooked
is if meritocracy is actually a *good* governing system...

## The dangers of meritocracy
Short answer: It's terrible, you can go to the next chapter
now.

Long answer: A persons prosperity under a meritocracy is
based of two traits: "Hard work" and "Intelligence". I
will explain further later, but maybe you can determine
if this is a good system or not based of this:

1. Hard work:    Fail
2. Intelligence: Fail
3. Neither:      Fail
4. Both:         Succeed

Have you thought about your answer? Well, it's... VERY BAD!
