# Meritocracy
*"The US is a meritocracy"*, one of the most blatant lies
ever told. There's no benefit to working hard, only the people
born into wealth (maybe by your father owning an emerald mine
in Africa, but I don't know) say this, either by blissful
ignorance or out of pure malice. But one thing often overlooked
is if meritocracy is actually a *good* governing system...

## The dangers of meritocracy
Short answer: It's terrible, you can go to the next chapter
now.

Long answer: A persons prosperity under a meritocracy is
based of two traits: "Hard work" and "Intelligence". I
will explain further later, but maybe you can determine
if this is a good system or not based of this:

1. Hard work:    Fail
2. Intelligence: Fail
3. Neither:      Fail
4. Both:         Succeed

Have you thought about your answer? Well, it's... VERY BAD!

### In-equal
We need to stop treating people differently based on how much
they've contributed to a project (contributions = merit in this
case). This is just straight up inequality and discourages
newcomers as they're treated much worse than the "devotees"
of the pack. It's almost like... A class system! This goes
against the principles of Technomarxism, as not everyone
is treated equally. FOSS-meritocracy leads to an eerily
similar class-system as to our real-world, where the
bourgeoise (devotees) are seen as "better" than the
proletariat (newcomers).

### Undemocratic
Meritocracy is largely undemocratic. What I mean by this is that
the newcomers almost have *no* say in anything, while the devotees
(or aristocrats in this situation) have *all* the say in the matter,
leading to a largely undemocratic system with large "class divide.",
which also leads to a hierarchy (and hierarchies are... Bad!?).

### Disorganized
It's unclear who makes the rules in a meritocracy. Is it the lead
developer, is it the people that have been contributing broken
code (yet a lot of it) or is it the people that contribute less,
yet better quality code? Even though I wish
