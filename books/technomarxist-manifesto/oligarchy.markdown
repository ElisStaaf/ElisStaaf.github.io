# Oligarchy
Okay... What do I mean with "Oligarchy"? I've been referring
to it for chapter upon chapter yet never provided an accurate
description for it. What I refer to as oligarchy can often
be swapped out for "donogarchy", which I define as:

*Donogarchy can be simplified -- just like "Charitocracy" --, into
a single sentence: Rule of the donators. People who donate to a
designated project rule it. What differentiates this from a
charitocracy is that this money doesn't go to a charity, but
to either the projects foundation or the owners wallet.*

But it is almost the same as oligarchy: *Rule of the rich*,
and oligarchy is a more well-known term (since I just defined
"donogarchy" here on the spot). It's a stupid governing
system whose only fans are schizophrenic weirdos who sit in
their room staring at a wall for 23 hours a day, as nobody in their
right mind would want rich people -- or donators -- to rule. There's
no freedom here, it's just *"Do what I say because I'm paying you"*!

## The power
Just to give you a sense of what these oligarchs will do if they even
get a whiff of you doing something you want. Godot -- an oligarchy --
experienced this under the [*"Wokot controversy"*](https://elisstaaf.github.io/books/technomarxist-manifesto/foss-culture#godot-foundation).
A bunch of oligarchs got really mad that Godot -- prepare for something
shocking -- cares about gay people? MIND BLOWN! So, they left and created
an "apolitical" (by which I mean: "conservative nationalist") fork of the
Godot engine known as "Redot" (an awful name for an awful engine made by
awful people). By the way, Redot is several commits behind Godot, so it's
inferior to its "woke" counterpart.
