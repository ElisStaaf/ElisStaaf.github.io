# The cat salesman IV
Now, regarding travel... How and where would you travel to get from
Gwynedd to Dyfed and vice versa? What would be the best path?

## The travelers guide
Take a look at the following image:

[![Map of wales](/images/wales-map.jpg)](/)

I'll let you ponder for a minute what the optimal path would be, and then
I'll show you... Okay, have you pondered? Now I'll show you the optimal
path to lug your carriage and 16 geese from Gwynedd to Dyfed, here it is:

[![The path](/images/wales-map-path.jpg)](/)

There are mountains everywhere, and you can't scale mountains with a carriage
and 16 geese/8 cats! You should therefore try to stick to the coast and then
later go trough an opening in the mountains. It's kind of important to consider
that... I don't know, there's like a 20% chance you die. Yes, like all kingdoms
in the 10th century, Wales was *incredibly* dangerous and I can't imagine that
the landscape of the time was all that pleasant.

## The pillagers
Yeah... I *wish* I had a solution to the pillagers ravaging the countryside
between Gwynedd and Dyfed, but I don't really do. The best way to avoid pillagers
would be equipping yourself with a sword or a bow, unfortunately adding more
ceiniogs to starting investment.

## The 90%
90% of the time while travelling you're either going to die or you're going to
lose a bunch of stuff, so basically "90% of cat salesmen get brutally mutilated
by pillagers on the countryside of Wales before they hit it big!". Huh. I think
we need to start reconsidering our... MATH CALCULATIONS! Did you think I was going
to give up on my dream as a cat salesman? No, but our math calculations are now
flawed.

## Math
Uhh, I'm not going to calculate the chance of dying because... You never really
know! You *could* say there's a ``P(1)`` chance of any chance being the correct
chance, therefore making any chance ``P(1) = P(x)``. No, the *real* thing we
need to reform is the value of 1 ce/ca -- which I'm going to be calling a ceca
(see-sey) from here on out because it's cooler (and I'm *very* cool) --, because
you might lose a few geese and cats along the way. Now, we *could* try to find
different times people took our route and if they got robbed, but we *could*
also be lazy and make an educated guess.

Now, we're going to be calculating a chance of getting killed/stolen per ride
and then just calculate *that*. But how? Well, I'm actually just going to guess
right here, let's say there's a ``P(1) = 40%`` chance (or risk? In my language
we say risk when the chance is bad, but not sure if it's like that in English)
of a goose or cat getting removed -- "removed" being a common word for killed
or stolen -- so we can say that per carriage ride, our animal storage (x), on
average, will be:

```
(1 - P(1)) * x
(1 - 0.4) * x
0.6 * x
```

So, for example, if our animal storage is 10, we will have 6 animals left in
our storage. This 40% thing is a *very* exaggerated estimate, as it was
probably much less than that, but I don't want to ruin your business by
underestimating the pillagers on the Wales countryside.

Yeah, enjoy your business, I guess.
