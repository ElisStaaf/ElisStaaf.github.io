# The cat salesman IV
Now, regarding travel... How and where would you travel to get from
Gwynedd to Dyfed and vice versa? What would be the best path?

## The travelers guide
Take a look at the following image:

I'll let you ponder for a minute what the optimal path would be, and then
I'll show you... Okay, have you pondered? Now I'll show you the optimal
path to lug your carriage and 16 geese from Gwynedd to Dyfed, here it is:

There are mountains everywhere, and you can't scale mountains with a carriage
and 16 geese/8 cats! You should therefore try to stick to the coast and then
later go trough an opening in the mountains. It's kind of important to consider
that... I don't know, there's like a 20% chance you die. Yes, like all kingdoms
in the 10th century, Wales was *incredibly* dangerous and I can't imagine that
the landscape of the time was all that pleasant.

## The pillagers
Yeah... I *wish* I had a solution to the pillagers ravaging the countryside
between Gwynedd and Dyfed, but I don't really do. The best way to avoid pillagers
would be equipping yourself with a sword or a bow, unfortunately adding more
ceiniogs to starting investment.
