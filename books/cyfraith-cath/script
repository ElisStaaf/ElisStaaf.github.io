# Introduction

Meow.  
Cats aren’t exactly known to follow the law,  BUT, back in the land of Medieval Wales,  
there existed a set of laws known as ‘Cyfraith  Cath’ – the law of the cats.
three different legal codes we are  shown a fascinating picture of just how  
valuable this beast was in medieval society. There are laws about what they should look like,  
what their jobs are, and how much  they’re worth. And most importantly,  
if you wanted to become a medieval cat salesman,  this video will teach you exactly how to do it.  
These are the medieval cat laws,  laws for your medieval cat.  

# Assigning Monetary Value to Your Cat’s Appearance

What? You can’t put a price on that face! Well, in medieval Wales you absolutely could.
I should clarify,  
Wales at this time was made up of several  kingdoms, and while the surviving legal texts  
are basically the same, there are several key  differences, which either reflect local changes,  
or just the passage of time.
The law in north Wales, ‘Dull Gwynedd’, is the  simplest. To have value, a cat must be able to:  
see and hear, it must have its claws, kill mice,  and not only be able to have kittens, but also  
not eat them.
The laws of cats in southwest Wales, ‘Dull  Dyfed’, are a little more particular:  
not only do they have to have all the qualities  listed above, but a cat must also have good teeth,  
and mustn’t wail at the moon. Finally in South Wales, 'Dull Gwent',
we come to the most specific. Not only must they  have all the qualities listed in North Wales,  
not only must they have the additions listed  in Southwest Wales, but they must also have  
a good tail, and not have any burn marks.
So as we can see, the general value of a cat here  
was to kill mice, and this was mostly reflected  in the qualities they were required to possess  
in order to hold any legal value. Plus the occasional addition of not  
wailing at the moon, and not… being burnt.
So… if your critter has all of these talents, how much could you get for it?
Every legal code here agrees on one specific thing, one fundamental concept: One adult cat is worth four ceiniog.
Now, we could sit here for 
over 
I can’t easily tell you what four ceiniog would  be worth today, I can tell you what it would’ve  
been equivalent to back then… in animals. So one adult cat, chiefly used to protect  
your barn from mice, had the same value  in north Wales as one adult goat.
four geese.
of its birth until August.
the equivalent of a post-August lamb.
So while trying to adopt a cat from your local  shelter in exchange for four geese might not  
work today, back then this would’ve been a  perfectly reasonable, legally valid trade.  
Interestingly, while all  the laws specify an adult,  
mouse-catching cat is worth four ceiniog, only  Gwynedd assigns a value to its previous form.  
So if you wanted to sell a kitten,  their laws have you covered.  
Once a cat is born, and until it opens its eyes,  it is worth one ceiniog.
of an adult cat. After that, it’s worth two  ceiniog.
where it reaches its final value of four.
difficult to… prove. Sure, you’ll be able  to see if a cat has opened their eyes,  
but you basically just have to take the  owner’s word that it can catch mice,  
unless you feel like hanging out with it in  a barn until you’ve seen the proof yourself.  
However, for all you hopeful  medieval cat-scammers out there,  
these laws have one more trick up their sleeve.  If a cat is deficient in any of these qualities,  
from mouse catching to having claws to  wailing at the moon, one third of its  
value must be returned.
bit of protection if their cat turns out to be  generally terrible, that also means the seller  
would be obligated to refund some money if the cat  they sold suddenly started wailing at the moon.  
Also, why did they make it so you had to return  one third of something worth four? I don’t know,  
but looking at this drawing of the codification of  the Welsh laws, do you think anyone here pondered  
on the return policy of cats?  

# Cat Products

You may have noticed something… unusual. Gwynedd  and Gwent just say “oh, if the cat is deficient  
in any qualities you’ll have to return some  value”, but uh, Dyfed is a little weird.  
They specify that you can be refunded one  third of the cat’s worth… because we don’t  
feed on its milk.
and its unique in this part of Wales. In fact, its so unique, the laws of Dyfed bring up  
this qualification twice, in what I believe is one  of the greatest legal passages in all of history.  
According to these laws, cats produce a product  known as Worthless Milk.
that alongside the milk of a female dog,  and a female horse, all three of these  
products will receive no compensation.
Moving on, we don’t have any more cat products,  
but we have laws about the ownership of  cats, and they’re a bit unexpected too.  
The laws of Gwynedd and Dyfed specify how  a married couple is to divide ownership of  
household furniture… which includes cats .
husband would own just one of the house’s cats,  every other one would belong to the wife.
Plus, if someone was to die and leave no  heir, their estate would pass to the king,  
and the official in charge of sorting all of  that out, known as a rhingyll, would get to  
keep a few things from the property.
the meat, the butter, the flax, the corn,  the hens, the fuel axe… and the cats.
These laws have some interesting differences  across Wales too, in Dyfed they let the official  
keep all of the axes.
So this establishes two things: firstly, if you  wanted to take up a career as a rhingyll, Gwent  
seems to have given you the most free stuff.
were the legal property of the wife in medieval  Wales.
an heir, they would pass to the king’s rhingyll .
plague, that the court officials would suddenly  be inundated with dozens and dozens of cats.  

# Cat Crime

Finally, 
There are two crimes outlined in the laws  
of Wales that are specifically to do with cats. The first is their fault: if a cat caused damage  
to someone’s flax garden while attempting  to catch a mouse, their owner would  
rightfully have to pay for the damages.
injured, or unfortunately worse. The  penalty for this is only mentioned  
in two of the legal texts, and is as follows. The cat is to be held with its head to the ground,  
and its tail lifted up. Wheat is then poured  around it until the tail is completely covered,  
and that is the fine paid to the owner.
Gwent's laws specify that is only the case if it happens to the king’s  cat.
Dyfed mention that the fine towards the  that cat can either be paid in wheat,  
or with an adult sheep and her lambs.
in this situation, for this fine of wheat to  be measured, which means in medieval Wales it  
was someone’s job to hold down a live cat on the  floor so that it can be covered in grain. Which  
could arguably be one of the most difficult jobs  a Welsh court official would ever have to face.  
We have now covered the three highly important  sectors of medieval Welsh cat law, cyfraith  
cath. Which means that we can finally come to the  most important question I have ever had to answer,  
one that we’ve all been wondering since  birth, whether you’ve known it or not.  
Mr Chronicles, if I were to time travel  back to medieval Wales and finally take  
up my life-long dream of becoming a  cat salesman, how would I do this?  

# How to be a Cat Salesman

## Step one: acquire product.

Luckily for you, in exchange for protein  
and nutrients, two cats can magically produce  several more, smaller ones: product secured.  
Alternatively, become a rhingyll during a time of  disease or war. Lots of empty, uninherited houses  
means lots of cats moving into your possession.

## Step two: maximise value.

As the laws in Gwynedd showed, an adult cat is worth far more  than a kitten, but the various law codes  
in Wales have different restrictions  on what makes a fully valuable cat.  
The laws from Gwynedd have the least requirements,  while the ones from Gwent have the most. So once  
you’ve acquired your cats, wait until they start  to catch mice, and make sure you move to Gwynedd,  
where you can sell your tailless,  toothless, inbred cats in peace.  

## Step three: reinvest your money. What  use is it if its just sitting around?  

If you sell enough cats you might be  able to afford a medieval mansion,  
but alternatively you could just double it. First, make sure you’re still in Gwynedd. Cool,  
then find some geese. The law codes from North  Wales value a goose at one ceiniog, so in exchange  
for one cat, you could get four geese. Next, travel down to Dyfed. The laws here  
specify a goose is worth two ceiniog. You  have now discovered the ultimate loophole,  
as long as you’re willing to travel for days  and days on end through remote, treacherous  
countryside, risking violence, and disease,  all while carrying several cats and geese.  
Not to mention this all depends on their  being a need for both cats and geese to  
be bought and sold, and also for these laws  to represent regional differences, because  
if you remember some of these surviving texts  might just show how the law evolved over time…  
But you can figure all of that out  then, I’m sure it’ll go just fine.  
Finally, don’t forget the  two most important steps:  

## Step four: do NOT sell cat milk.

If you recall,  cat milk is legally worthless, don’t even try it.  

## Step five: for morale, always try to  remember the most famous cat of all: Garfield.

Specifically, that the Welsh laws  of the cats were actually mentioned in an  
episode of The Garfield Show.
personally proclaim that cats are to be  protected, because they are “cute, clever,  
and… excellent at catching mice”.
mention them being clever, sorry Garfield. So now you can sell your cats in the wilds  
of Wales, knowing that following this simple  five step plan will bring you great riches,  
and with your newfound wealth, you will  be forever remembered throughout history  
as the richest cat salesman Wales has ever seen.
As thanks to me for creating this foolproof plan,  
you will fund a statue, with a plaque,  simply saying “thanks, Cambrian Chronicles”,  
and it will puzzle historians for years to  come, until ultimately falling into obscurity,  
with none of it surviving apart from vague  notes and mentions from centuries ago.  
Until, one day, in an old forgotten journal,  I come across a mention of an odd ancient  
statue in Wales. “Huh, Cambrian Chronicles,  that sounds like the perfect name for that  
YouTube channel I’ve been wanting to make”. And then, again, this video is made, and then,  
again, the future you is inspired to once more  go back in time and become a cat salesperson,  
starting the cycle again, and  again, and again, and again.  
We will be like two washing machines  placed opposite one another,  
forever cycling, forever linked. And after all that, you might be thinking,  
what is the takeaway from all of this?  How am I meant to feel after this  
fundamentally ego-altering information? Well, I said it at the very start:
