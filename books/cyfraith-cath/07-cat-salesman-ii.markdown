# The cat salesman II
Don't use your time machine yet! There's some more stuff I need to say!
This chapter was so long that I needed to split it into multiple parts!
Uhh, lets continue!

## The graph
I've constructed a graph for you showing the loop of the cat salesman.
This graph summarizes what I want to say *pretty* well? It all boils
down to:

- Acquire cat.
  - Become rhingyll.
  - Purchase cat.
- Inbreed cat.
- Move to Gwynedd.
- Loop
  - Trade cats for four geese each.
  - Move to Dyfed.
  - Trade 2 geese for one cat each.
- Cash in.
- Repeat loop.

But for all of you intricacy-addicts out there, this is the full graph
explaining all of the intricacies of being a cat salesman:

[![The cat loop](/images/cat-loop.png)](/)

*Red = Starting point, Blue = Prerequisites, Yellow = Loop component,
Green = External event/purchase*

If you want to become an expert cat salesman, do this and you'll be there
in no time! It *is* possible that you *die* while moving from Gwynedd to
Dyfed but eh, whatever! YOLO.

## Medieval purrsuits
Oh, so you haven't acquired a time machine yet. Well, that's okay! There exists
a really good, funny and entertaining game about becoming a cat salesman in medieval
Wales. Play it on itchio [here](https://baconeggsrl.itch.io/cyfraith-cath-medieval-purrsuits),
it's good. You won't regret it. 

## When should you profit?
I made a rough estimation on how many cats you should get before selling n - 2 of them
for 4 * (n - 2) ceiniog, but scientifically, when should you profit? How many geese and/or
cats can you transport?

A cat, on average at 2+ years of age is supposed to weigh around 4kg. A goose on average
weighs 3.5kg. Your average human male's upper limit in how many kilograms he can carry
is 26kg and 16kg for a woman. Calculating the average weight a human can carry proves
to be easy:

```
(26 + 16) / 2 = 21
```

So your average human can carry 21kg of weight. Using this, we can calculate how many
cats and/or geese a human can carry using:

```
21 / 4 = 5.25
21 / 3.5 = 6
```

Since we shouldn't cut kittens into four pieces, the upper limit of cats for a human
to carry would be 5 cats. This means that, without equipment, we can trade for 4 geese,
to begin with:

```
1 cat -> 4 geese
4 geese -> 2 cat
```

So we can barely carry 4 geese and now we're about to carry 8. At this point it's over.
To successfully trade cats in this day and age you would need some starting capital of...
Well, I don't know. You'd need enough starting capital (money-capital, to be exact) to
be able to invest in a horse and a carriage, but if you're a farmer in these ages you
probably have all of these things already. If not, you need starting money capital.
A good way to acquire this would be by selling your assets. It's not like you're
going to live on your farm anymore! You're going to be a travelling soul! With this,
you need to invest in a carriage to be able to carry your capital and product.
