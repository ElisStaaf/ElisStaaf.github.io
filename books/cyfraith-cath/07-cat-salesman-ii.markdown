# The cat salesman II
Don't use your time machine yet! There's some more stuff I need to say!
This chapter was so long that I needed to split it into multiple parts!
Uhh, lets continue!

## The graph
I've constructed a graph for you showing the loop of the cat salesman.
This graph summarizes what I want to say *pretty* well? It all boils
down to:

- Acquire cat.
  - Become rhingyll.
  - Purchase cat.
- Inbreed cat.
- Move to Gwynedd.
- Loop
  - Trade cats for four geese each.
  - Move to Dyfed.
  - Trade 2 geese for one cat each.
- Cash in.
- Repeat loop.

But for all of you intricacy-addicts out there, this is the full graph
explaining all of the intricacies of being a cat salesman:

[![The cat loop](/images/cat-loop.png)](/)

*Red = Starting point, Blue = Prerequisites, Yellow = Loop component,
Green = External event/purchase*

If you want to become an expert cat salesman, do this and you'll be there
in no time! It *is* possible that you *die* while moving from Gwynedd to
Dyfed but eh, whatever! YOLO.

## Training
Oh, so you haven't acquired a time machine yet. Well, that's okay! There exists
a really good, funny and entertaining game about becoming a cat salesman in medieval
Wales. Play it on itchio [here](https://baconeggsrl.itch.io/cyfraith-cath-medieval-purrsuits),
it's good. You won't regret it.
