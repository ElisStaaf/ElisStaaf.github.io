# The Cyfraith Cath 
Do you, by any chance, like cats? Do you *not* like cats but want
to sell them? Do you *also* happen to live in Wales between the years
of 942 CE and 950 CE? I hope so, because if not, this book/essay is
of no use to you! Literally. Of no use. This book contains all the
instructions for you to create a cat salesman empire in Wales between
the years of 942 CE and 950 CE while still following the law of cats
(called *Cyfraith Cath*, hence the name of this book) from that time;
this book is as such only useful if you somehow acquire a time machine
and travel back to this time; if not: though luck.
