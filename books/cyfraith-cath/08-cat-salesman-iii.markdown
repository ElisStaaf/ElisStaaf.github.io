# The cat salesman III
Investing in a carriage is your next problem. And also my next problem,
it's really hard to calculate how many animals fit on a carriage.

## The carriage
After searching upon searching upon searching I found a source claiming
that a standard carriage is 5-10 ft wide and 10-15 ft long. I don't speak
freedom units, so lets firstly calculate the average of this and then
convert to meters.

```
(5 + 10) / 2 = 7.5
(10 + 15) / 2 = 12.5
```

One foot is 30.48cm, which is now our basis for conversion:

```
7.5 * 30.48 = 228.6
12.5 * 30.48 = 381
```

We then convert this to meters:

```
228.6cm = 2.286m
381cm = 3.81m
```

Then we round both of these up to full meters, becoming 2m and 4m.
Now, we need to calculate the area of the carriage using:

```
2m * 4m = 8m²
```

So the area of the carriage is 8m².
