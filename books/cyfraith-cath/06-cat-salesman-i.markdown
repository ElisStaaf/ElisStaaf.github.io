# The cat salesman I
So, have you found your time machine yet? Are you ready to become the richest
cat salesman in the welsh lands? No? Okay, well if you want to know what could
have been if you were to invent one, read further. Yes? Okay, read further.

## Acquire cats
So, are you to acquire your product? You have two options here.

### The inbreeding method
This method requires 8 ceiniog (or alternatively enough animals or products to trade for the
same amount of cats) and a lack of empathy and morals. What you're going to do is that your
going to purchase two cats. Then -- almost magically -- with enough nutrients these cats
magically produce smaller cats. Proceed to inbreed these cats until they look like the cat
from the painting in "Cat products":

### The rhingyll method
I mentioned this during "Cat products" too, using this labyrinth:

[![The labyrinth](/images/rhingyll.png)](/)

It all boils down to you becoming a rhingyll during a time of crisis, then:
there'll be many, many cats waiting to come into your possession. Again, proceed to
inbreed these cats until they look like the cat from the painting in "Cat products".

## Remove restriction
As we've already mentioned, Gwynedd has the least requirements for your cats to have
value. So make sure to move to Gwynedd (this is also important for another step in the
plan) so you can sell your burned, tailless, toothless, moon-wailing and inbred cats
successfully and with minor resistance.

## Reinvest value
Okay, so now you own product, right? Eh, not really. These cats are closer to capital
as very few of them get sold in the optimal method. Now, you could just sell your burned,
tailless, toothless, moon-wailing and inbred cats, but what value is that? Your profits
(unless you use the rhingyll method) are simply neutral. You don't want neutrality in
business, you want cash! Thus, your cats are now capital. How? Well, do you remember
how I said that one cat in Gwynedd was worth 4 geese? Do you *also* remember how
one cat in Dyfed was worth 2? Do you see what I mean? Your cats are now capital as
you trade your cats in Gwynedd for 4 geese each. Then, move to Dyfed and sell 2
geese for one cat each! Do you get me?

```
1 cat -> 4 geese,
2 geese -> 1 cat,

1 cat -> 4 geese -> 2 cat,
1 cat -> 2 cat,

```

Yes. You just doubled your capital! Or maybe *catpital*? I'm so funny! So just travel
back and forth and back and forth trough these lands. Granted, you need to travel
across one of the most dangerous countrysides of its time but you can solve this!
With your determination you'll survive anything! Maybe. I really couldn't know.

## Resist temptation
The next important thing to do is to resist temptation. DO NOT SELL CAT MILK. If
you get tempted to do such, I'm pretty sure you'd have to pay a fine.

## Cash in
I'd say you'd want to consider cashing in on your hard work after, say:

```
1 cat -> 4 geese,
2 geese -> 1 cat,

2 cat -> 8 geese,
4 geese, 2 cat,

4 cat -> 12 geese,
6 geese -> 2.5 cat

...

64 geese -> 32 cat

(2x)
```

Not only because that's a lot of cats, but also because it would start to get difficult
to carry all of these things. Then, I recommend selling your number of cats (n) - 2, you'd
earn this amount of money:

```
4(x - 2)
```

And then, with 32 cats, this would be the amount of money you'd earn:

```
4(x - 2) for x = 32:
    4 * (32 - 2) = 4 * (30) =
    (4 * 3) * 10 = 12 * 10 = 120
```

You'd earn 120 ceiniog which you can reinvest if you'd like or you can
just purchase that cloak you've really wanted to buy.
