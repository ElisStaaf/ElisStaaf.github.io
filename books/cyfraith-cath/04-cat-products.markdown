# Cat products
A cat. Does it produce any products? Does it produce anything of value?
Is it just a mouse-catching machine? Well, Dyfed believes that a cat produces
one worthless product: milk.

## Cat milk
I am disgusted and appalled. But it seems like Dyfed also believes that; it
specifically says that cat milk is a *worthless* product, but the way they
phrase it is funny as hell. In the laws, they specify that cats produce a product
known as "Worthless Milk". They share this property with the female dog and the
female horse. I hate knowing that there once was a law in medieval Wales that mentioned
worthless cat milk.

## Cats in general
Come to think of it, aren't cats in general pretty... Useless? Besides catching mice, of
course, they don't really do anything? You don't eat them (I hope) and you don't drink
their milk. You can't possibly acquire any product from them! Their bodies are to small,
hence the fur can't make a coat, everything about them is pure uselessness! Besides catching
mice, their only use is being cute, and I can tell you, these medieval people did *not* see
cats as cute! This is a *REAL* painting made by a *REAL* person in the middle ages:

A *REAL* painting. From the middle ages. A *REAL* painting. Well, enough of that, let's
continue to ramble about other middle-age-wales-cat-law shenanigans!

## Cats as products
Once you owned a cat, how did that go? Where there any laws about the ownership of cats
after they (as products and commodities) have been purchased? Yes there were, are you
stupid? Gwynedd and Dyfed specifically. They have laws specifying how a married couple
should divide ownership of furniture. There is -- as everyone knows -- a very well known
piece of furniture known as a *cat*. Yes, Gwynedd and Dyfed classify a cat as a piece
of furniture, ignore it. If the couple only owned one cat, the husband would get it.
*But*, if the couple owned more than one cat, the husband would get one while the
wife would get the rest of the cats. In a household with 5 cats, cats A-E for example,
the husband would own A, while the wife would own B, C, D and E. And if *these* people
died without an heir, their goods would be taken by the state and predominantly the
king. The poor person chosen to sort these goods out, the rhingyll, would get some
of the riches though. This includes cats. They would get *all* of them, in fact. This
mean that under a very specific chain of events you *could* get rich of being a
rhingyll. See the following tree of events:

- Couple a owns x cats.
- Couple a dies without heir?
  - No?
    - End of tree. You don't acquire cats
  - Yes?
    - x > 1?
      - No?
        - x = 1?
          - No?
            - End of tree. Not enough cats.
          - Yes?
            - Purchase cat?
              - No?
                - End of tree. Not enough cats.
              - Yes?
                - Become a cat salesman and exploit a trick in the system (more on that later).
      - Yes?
        - Become a cat salesman and exploit a trick in the system (more on that later).

I also simplified it into one labyrinth for you. Think of it like those choice
labyrinths you see sometimes. Eh, I'll just show you:
