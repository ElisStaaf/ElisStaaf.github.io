# The trading and commodifying of cats
In medieval Wales, trading cats was *pretty*, *pretty* easy. Especially in north
Wales, where its laws, "Dull Gwynedd" only specify that to trade a cat, it must:

## Dull Gwynedd
- See and hear
- Have its claws
- Be able to kill mice
- Be able to have kittens + not eat them.

Which is a pretty generous ruleset for the trading of a cat, but you do you, Dull
Gwynedd! But in other places, trading was more restricted, with some rules being
downright *absurd*, but it's medieval Wales, what do you expect?

## Dull Dyfed
In southwest Wales, the laws, "Dull Dyfed" were a tad bit more restricted, with
cats needing to meet the requirements of Dull Gwynedd, but also:

- Have good teeth
- Not... Wail at the... Moon?

Huh? Why mustn't a cat wail at the moon? Isn't that meaningless? Aww, is little Hywel
scared of cats wailing at the moon? Aww! But this isn't the most restrictive of the
three laws, that would be

## Dull Gwent
In south wales, the laws named "Dull Gwent" are very restrictive, needing to meet all
requirements of Dull Gwynedd *and* Dull Gwent, while also needing to:

- Have a good... Tail?
- Not have any... Burn... Marks?

Alright, these laws are getting meaningless! I get Dull Gwynedd and *sometimes* Dull Dyfed
but this is just absurd? Good tail? Burn marks? Does that matter that much to you, Hywel?
They should call you *Hywel the picky one*! Haha!

## Monetary value
So, does your cat meet the requirements of the province you're living in? Yes? *And* you want
to know the price of your little feline? Okay, sure! All of these laws agree on the price,
so there are no specifics on that. One adult cat is worth four "ceinog"; the currency of
"ceinog" was Wales's currency at the time. What a ceinog was worth, I couldn't possibly
comment on. The closest frame of reference I have is that a cat in the 80s could be
bought for ~2100kr (that's Swedish currency, me living in Sweden and all), one kronor
is basically equal to 0.1x where x is the number of usd. Taking this into account:

```
0.1x for x = 2100:
    0.1 * 2100 = 2100 / 10 = 210
```
meaning that 2100kr is equal to 210usd. Working from this thesis, we can calculate
the value of a ceinog using an equation:

```
4c = 210
4c/4 = 210/4
c = 52.5
```

We can say that if prices were fair (which they were *probably* not) one ceinog would be
worth ~$53, with one cat costing 4c. This is all meaningless, though, since you can
just compare it with the animals of its time. One cat is equal to

- Dull Gwynedd
  - One goat (4c {$210})
  - Four geese (1c {$53} * 4)
  - Four chicken (1c {$53} * 4)
- Dull Dyfed
  - Two Geese (2c {$106} * 2 )
  - One and a half goats ((1.5c {$79.5} / 1.5) * 3)
  - One lamb (in... August?) (4c {$210})
- Dull Gwent
  - One lamb (4c {$210})
  - Four piglets (1c {$53} * 4)
  - Four ducks (1c {$53} * 4)

One interesting thing is that Gwynedd -- and *only* Gwynedd -- specifies the value for
a cat either not adult or non mouse-catching. In their laws, one kitten (a cat that
has "not yet opened its eyes") is worth 1c, then 2c. Only when (or *if*) it catches
mice it becomes worth 4c.

## Returning a cat
If a cat has any "defection" (*defection* being used as *unwanted trait*), the seller
is obligated to return... Two thirds of the price? Uhh... What? I understand that
if your cat suddenly starts "wailing at the moon" you need compensation. But two
thirds? Why not three fourths or maybe one half?

*"Dumnagual, which is your REAL first name to be clear, you
sold me a defective cat."*  
*"Gwenhwyvach, which is your REAL first name to be clear,
what do you mean?"*  
*"Dumnagual, do you not understand? My cat just... WAILED AT THE
MOON"*  
*"Gwenhwyvach, I didn't"*  
*"YOU FRAUD, YOU ABSOLUTE SGLYFATH, WHICH IS A REAL INSULT IN THE
WELSH LANGUAGE. YOU TWMFFAT, WHICH IS A REAL INSULT IN MY TIME!"*  
*"Gwenhwyvach, which is your real first name, what can I do to
repay you?"*  
*"Dumnagual, return pay me back two thirds of the price!"*  
*"Which is..?"*  
*"(4 / 3) * 2... So like 2.66666666..."*
