# Cultism
Republicans and FOSS-users have yet another thing in common: Cultism. USA's
president Donald J. Trump, -- the racist businessman -- has built a kind of
"cult of personality" around himself. And then we have pedophile-sympathizer
Richard Stallman, who has done the same thing.

PRAISE STALLMAN  
ENDORSE STALLMAN  
FORGIVE STALLMAN

## And Stallman returns
Stallman? Why would we mention Stallman again? Well... The thing I mentioned
in ["Tribalism"](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/foss-culture#tribalism) was... Only *one* of the controversies.
*"Gasp!"*, I hear you say! But fret not, there's this very good paper on
all of his controversial activity which I've taken a lot of this info from!
So... If you want to read more on the topic, read it [here](https://https://stallman-report.org/).
But basically, this is all of the problematic behaviour that is documented
in the informal paper:

- Distinction between "children" and other minors
- Support of child sexual abuse material
- Defense of sexual misconduct
- Support of sex between adults and minors
- Misrepresentation of sexual assault
- Misrepresentation of sexual harassment
- Support of bestiality
- Support of necrophilia

And we have only mentioned *one* of them. *"But no! He didn't mean it! He's
a different person now!"*, no. It's more like *"Instead of being a pedophile-sympathizer,
he's a pedophilia, sexual-assault, bestiality, necrophilia, sexual-misconduct and child
sexual abuse material sympathizer!"*... So yeah, Stallman is mentally ill, and he should
*probably* get some therapy. But in this context, I don't care about what he did, I only
-- as a FOSS-cultism investigator -- care about what the response from the community was.
NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING!
