# Waiting For Marxocracy
Have you ever thought about how FOSS-projects are run? Are they democracies, dictatorships,
or maybe even oligarchs? What is the optimal way of running a FOSS-project?
Also, how do we enact the correct policy, remain human and not die in the process?
Technomarxist Manifesto is a deep dive into this and more: Like communism in FOSS.

## TL;DR
The optimal way of running a FOSS project is trough direct democracy, we should
own most software collectively and not let ourselves get corrupted by oligarchs and
big companies donating â‚¬10,000,000 to your cause (totally not because they want
to control your project).

## How do you read this?
This books is split into different chapters, covering different problems and
solutions of the FOSS-community. You are free to read them in non-chronological
order, but I strongly recommend to read them in order.

ways of controlling FOSS in the most fair way possible? If so, you can go to
