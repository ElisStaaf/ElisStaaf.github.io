# Waiting For Marxocracy
Welcome, and thanky you for reading my book! This is a view into the political
landscape of FOSS and IT as a whole. In this book, I explore concepts such as
democracy, oligarchy and corporate interest with a FOSS spin to it. I also try
to design an ultimate governing system for FOSS and IT as a whole. This book
also serves as a manifesto of sorts, presenting clear ideas on how to run a
project.

## TL;DR
The optimal way of running a FOSS project is trough direct democracy, we should
own most software collectively and not let ourselves get corrupted by oligarchs and
big companies donating â‚¬10,000,000 to your cause (totally not because they want
to control your project).

## How do you read this?
This book is split into different chapters, covering different problems and
solutions of the FOSS-community. You are free to read them in non-chronological
order, but I strongly recommend to read them in order. This book is also split
into 3 different writing types and subjects, they are:
- FOSS
- Politics
- Philosophy

## Get started

ways of controlling FOSS in the most fair way possible? If so, you can go to
