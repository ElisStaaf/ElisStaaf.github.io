# Remaining human
It's easy to forget that FOSS-developers (which includes *me*) are humans too. The
sad thing with doing this FOSS-politics thing I'm talking about is that... It's
easy to lose yourself. When trying to push for democracy, you might find yourself
a "political martyr" or just a coder and not human. *"How do I, a coder, remain
human?"*

## What is humanity?
Humanity is basically having a soul, a personality! It's the thing we *don't* want
to lose. A soul is -- if you're an atheist like me -- just hormonal reactions in
the body, but in this chapter we're talking about the philosophical definition:
Basically just an arbitrary thing that exists and makes you feel things.
