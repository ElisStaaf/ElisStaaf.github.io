# Liberty
Liberty. Y'know, the thing. The thing that, like, hasn't helped anyone (in FOSS).
FOSS-liberty can be summed up with the following satirical piece:

[![Liberty!](/images/liberty.png)](/)

Honestly, libertarian FOSS-projects *tend* to be worse... But hey! They're extensible,
am I right? Free and extensible is the only *good* qualities about FOSS-libertarianism.
Speaking of FOSS-libertarianism, it's been 11 chapters, shouldn't I provide a definition
at some point? And should *"at some point"* be now? Yeah, let's go with that.

## Conlibertism
*FOSS-libertarianism is the "FOSS" (Free and Open Source Software) variant of libertarianism,
meaning "freedom in software", this correlates with Fossarchy-Mossarchy, but is more on the
"consuming" side of the FOSS process. But when we speak of FOSS-libertarianism, we might mean
"Pure-FOSS-libertarianism", which is when you can do anything with the consumption of a
FOSS-project.*

But FOSS-libertarianism and Pure-FOSS-libertarianism are very long terms, so we'll call them
"Conlibertism" (Consumption libertarianism) and "Pureconlibertism" (Pure consumption
libertarianism).
